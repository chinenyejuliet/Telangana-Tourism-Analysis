### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves exploring visitor's datasets and answering the following questions:

visitors overall (2016 - 2022) (Insight: Get an overview of districts that are doing well).
2. List down the top 3 districts based on compounded annual growth rate
(CAGR) of visitors between (2016 - 2022).
3. List down the bottom 3 districts based on compounded annual growth rate
(CAGR) of visitors between (2016 - 2022).
(Insight: Districts that are declining)
4. What are the peak and low season months for Hyderabad based on the
data from 2016 to 2022 for Hyderabad district?
(Insight: Government can plan well for the peak seasons and boost low
seasons by introducing new events).

ratio?

bottom districts which can improve the foreign visitors as foreign visitors
will bring more revenue).
