To develop an in-depth understanding of the state's datasets for domestic and foreign visitors, identify trends and patterns, make data-driven recommendation and provide insights for the Telegana Government Tourism Department.

### Tools
- Excel Power Query - For Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading.
- Excel - For Data Cleaning and Analysis.
- Excel _ For Dashboard Visualization.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the process of data cleaning/preparation, we perfomed the following task:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Merging various datasets.
- Handling missing values and correcting mispelled data.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involves exploring visitor's datasets and answering the following questions:
1. List down the top 10 districts that have the highest number of domestic
visitors overall (2016 - 2022) (Insight: Get an overview of districts that are doing well).
2. List down the top 3 districts based on compounded annual growth rate
(CAGR) of visitors between (2016 - 2022).
3. List down the bottom 3 districts based on compounded annual growth rate
(CAGR) of visitors between (2016 - 2022).
(Insight: Districts that are declining)
4. What are the peak and low season months for Hyderabad based on the
data from 2016 to 2022 for Hyderabad district?
(Insight: Government can plan well for the peak seasons and boost low
seasons by introducing new events).
5. Show the top & bottom 3 districts with high domestic to foreign tourist
ratio?
(Insight: Government can learn from top districts and replicate the same to
bottom districts which can improve the foreign visitors as foreign visitors
will bring more revenue).
